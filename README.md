# Project Overview 
Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches\
Optimized Multiple-Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest models using GridsearchCV

### Use of this Project

This project is for the fantasy cricket fans out there, helping them to earn extra fantasy points for Dream11 IPL, Team 11 and MPL etc ..

### Packages Used
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, Django, HTML, CSS\
Tools Used: Jupyter notebook and Sublime Text \
Data Set taken from the kaggle

### Model evaluation

Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\
• Multiple Linear Regression - 15.843\
• Decision Tree - 23.044\
• Random Forest - 18.171\

Taken the Multiple linear regression model for prediction results because it has best accuray and RMSE among the models
